# An archetype for Composum Platform Subprojects

This was created with mvn archetype:create-from-project and then modified. So for creating new archetypes this
would be a good approach.

Create a project with this using:

    mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=com.composum.meta.ist.archetype -DarchetypeArtifactId=composum-platform-subproject-archetype
